# RasPi_GPIO_test
Just a test of RasPi 4B's GPIO speed, nothing special... The goal is reading a 12bit parallel signal with signal clock.

Python and C shared object are used. Direct register access from C program is the fastest method.

Some of the if-else cnditions are place holders since this is just a test.
